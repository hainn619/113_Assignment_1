    <p>My name is Hai Nguyen, I am 34 years old and live in a town called Kendal in Cumbria, England with my wife Emily and my daughter Elsa. It’s a beautiful part of the world and a place I can truly call home.</p>
    
    
    
    <p>I have spent the past few years building blogs and making an income from them so I can enjoy living in the countryside where I can enjoy lots of my favourite hobbies and not have to worry about living in a city with lots of traffic and that hectic way of life.</p>
    
    
    
    <p>I also have 2 dogs called Max and Grace, who I take out for walks everyday. Not sure who’s walking who if I’m honest.</p>
    
    
    
    <p>My blog is built on WordPress (self-hosted). I currently use <a href="https://generatepress.com/?ref=3361" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GeneratePress</a>, a premium WordPress theme.</p>
    
    
    
    <p>For <a href="https://makeawebsitehub.com/reviews/hosting/">blog hosting</a>, I recommend <a href="https://makeawebsitehub.com/go/bluehost" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">BlueHost</a>. It is easy-to-use, reliable, and inexpensive. It also has superb, 24-7 support. It is the only hosting service I personally recommend. Plus you get a free domain when you sign up. Use <a href="https://makeawebsitehub.com/go/bluehost" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">my link</a> to get hosting for just $2.95 per month.</p>
